# Our History
It's surprising how often we are asked about our experience and what makes us qualified to suggest hardware and cloud-based solutions. Cirrascale was a premier developer of blade and rackmount solutions enabling large scale compute infrastructure. Cirrascale leveraged its patented Vertical Cooling Technology and proprietary PCIe switch riser technology to provide the industry's densest rackmount and blade-based peered multi-GPU platforms.

In late 2015, Cirrascale Corporation decided to launch a cloud service to help those customers interested in a more robust and versatile cloud offering for multi-GPU solutions. The service was well received, and in early 2017, BOXX Technologies acquired Cirrascale Corporation and its assets. The acquisition enabled BOXX to add Cirrascale's deep learning hardware to its line of multi-GPU solutions and solidified BOXX as the leader in multi-GPU computer technology.

Cirrascale Cloud Services was kept as a separate entity and now continues to expand its growing business and provide GPU-as-a-Service and other professional services offerings to customers like you.
