# "Cat Or Not" 

Each step in the development of a deep learning based soltion presents unique challenges for:
- Compute resource management
- Dataset Storage and Labeling
- Source code management
- Scalable and cost effective training

A highlevel overview of the normal maturation of a deep learning project is outlined in the figure below.
